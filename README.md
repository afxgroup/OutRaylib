</p>

A simple OutRun clone based on https://codeincomplete.com/articles/javascript-racer-v4-final/ and translated into C++ with ChatGPT help.  
The game use Raylib to manage graphics and window handling.   
Minor changes and refactoring has been done manually (for example wrap the code into C++ classes).

# Music Tracks

Music tracks are generated by AI too (and a watermark is present in the tracks). You can change the tracks with all you preferred tracks. Just overwrite the existing music tracks with yours.  

# How to play

Use cursor keys to move. Up to accelerate, down to decelerate.  
Use `1` to change music tracks.  
Use `ESC` to quit.
Use `SPACE` to pause the game.  

## TODO

- Some minor changes to reflect the Javascript version
- New implementations (?)
