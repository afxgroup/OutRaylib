# OutRaylib

A simple OutRun clone based on https://codeincomplete.com/articles/javascript-racer-v4-final/ and translated into C++ with ChatGPT.  
Minor changes and refactoring has been done manually (for example wrap the code into classes).

# Music Tracks

Music tracks are generated by AI too (and a watermark is present in the tracks).

# How to play

Use cursor keys to move. Up to accelerate, down to decelerate.  
Use `1` to change music tracks.  
Use `ESC` to quit.
